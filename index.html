  <h1>Emmett Luzar Project 1</h1>
  <p>I will use this web page to show off a picture of my dog,
    Squiggy.</p>
  <p>Here he is:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="thumbnail_IMG_2720.jpg" alt="Squiggy"
      style="width: 300px; height: auto;" />
  </p>
  <p>My favorite things about Squiggy in no particular order are as
    follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He is so adorable (as you can see in the picture above)</li>
    <li>He is very nice and loving. He has never hurt anyone, and
      will let you pick him up without any fuss.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are a couple things that I don't like about Squiggy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When he barks. He does it loud and often</li>
    <li>When he chooses to get pet by someone else when I am in the
      room</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here is a table providing some basic information about Squiggy:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Breed</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Favorite Toy</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Schnoodle (Schnauzer mixed with Poodle)</td>
      <td>At least 7</td>
      <td>His beds (he tears them up all the time but also sleeps
        in them)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
